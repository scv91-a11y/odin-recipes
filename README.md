HTML - assignment
This project is part of my HTML assignment for The Odin Project (TOP). 

In this assignment, I demonstrate my ability to build a simple HTML webpage using elements such as anchor, img, unordered and ordered lists. I also showcase how to connect relative links to an absolute link page and practice using essential Git commands for version control.
